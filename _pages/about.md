My name is Fanjie Kong. I received my Ph.D. degree from the Electrical and Computer Engineering(ECE) Department at Duke University. My Ph.D. advisor is [Prof. Ricardo Henao](https://rhenaog.github.io/). My current research mainly focuses on open-vocabulary object detection, efficient vision models and Fairness in AI. For additional details regarding my academic and professional experiences, please refer to my [CV](../files/Fanjie Kong-CV-2024Spring3.pdf).
