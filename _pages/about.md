My name is Fanjie Kong, a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Electrical and Computer Engineering(ECE) Department at Duke University, working with [Prof. Ricardo Henao](https://rhenaog.github.io/). My current research mainly focuses on open-vocabulary object detection, efficient vision models and Fairness in AI. For additional details regarding my academic and professional experiences, please refer to my [CV](../files/Fanjie Kong-CV-2023Fall.pdf).

<span style="color:red">With an anticipated graduation in 2024, I am actively seeking opportunities in industry roles, such as scientist positions.</span>
